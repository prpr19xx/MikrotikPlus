# MikrotikPlus
This is a C++ connector which wraps the Mikrotik/RouterOS API.

It works well under Windows, Linux and possibly Mac.

It does not use any dependencies at all.

To build this, you will have to download the source code and navigate to its directory. Then, you will do this:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -G generator ..
```

https://github.com/zx2512/MikrotikSnooperToMySQL/ is an example project which uses this library
